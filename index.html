<h2> My Family </h2>
<img src= "images/Family.jpg" alt="Picture of family" width="600">
<p>I have a pretty big family and I love them all and they are the best family members ever. My mom was born in San Pedro and raised there and my dad lived in San Pedro also till they both moved to long beach. I have 1 sister and 3 brothers but only 1 of my brothers still lives with me.

<h2> Hobbies </h2>

<p> 
At home I enjoy playing video games, skating, and dirtbiking. I go dirtbiking almost every weekend and skate almost every day and I love doing those things as much and as often as I can. I ride dirtbikes with my brother and my step dad and I skate with my friends from school.

<h2> Skills </h2>

<p> 
 My skils are skateboarding, playing video games, typing pretty fast, cooking top ramen, and dirtbiking. I practice doing these things a lot so I have became very skilled in doing these activites. The thing I'm best at is probably skateboarding because I can do some pretty cool tricks and I practice a lot especially during summer.

<h2> Interests </h2>

<p> I enjoy learning outside of school because I feel like I can learn a lot more doing my own research than in school. I watch a lot of science videos at home and read about a lot of different subjects so I can maximize my learning on things I want/need to know and it is very entertaining.
