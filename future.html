 I want to go to lakewood high school because all of my brothers and sisters did and they said it was a great school with lots of programs I&rsquo;d like. I am very excited to go to this school with all of my friends and meet new teachers and start becoming an adult.

<h2> College </h2>

I hope to get into Arizona State University as it is a very good school and I have family that went there. I have been there and seen many different things they have there and it was a very nice school with very nice people who always help you if you need help with something.

<h2> Career Interests </h2>

<p>  I am not sure yet what I want to do but I want it to be something creative and something that helps people. I also want to entertain people and make some sort of art. I wont do my job if I do not enjoy it and if I am not making a lot of money.
</p> 
<h2> Goals </h2>

<p> 
 I want to be successful and happy and be different than everyone else and not do a normal job just like every other person. I want to make an impact on people and be remembered for doing good things on this planet.
